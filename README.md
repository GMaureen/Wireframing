# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide or blueprint that represents the layout and structure of a digital product such as a website or an application. It shows the placement of elements like buttons, images, and text without focusing on colors, styles, or detailed design.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process because it:
- Helps plan the structure and functionality before coding begins
- Serves as a communication tool between designers, developers, clients, and stakeholders
- Allows quick iteration and experimentation at low cost
- Helps identify usability issues early and reduces rework later

## How to Use This Repo
This repository contains an introduction to wireframing and can be expanded with:
- Example low-fidelity wireframes (images or SVGs)
- Links to tools (e.g., Figma, Sketch)
- A simple wireframe checklist

## Conclusion
Wireframes turn abstract ideas into clear layouts that guide design and development. They save time and help teams align on product structure early on.

## Key Elements of Wireframing

Wireframes include several important elements that define how a user interacts with a digital product. The four key elements are **Layout Structure**, **Navigation**, **Content Placement**, and **Functionality**.

### Layout Structure
Defines how different components are arranged on a page or screen.
**Example:** A homepage wireframe might include a header at the top, content in the middle, and a footer at the bottom. This ensures consistency and balance in design.

### Navigation
Shows how users move through different sections of a website or application.
**Example:** A navigation bar or menu helps users easily switch between pages like Home, About, and Contact.

### Content Placement
Determines where text, buttons, and images appear on the page.
**Example:** Placing the main headline at the top and the call-to-action button near the center draws user attention effectively.

### Functionality
Represents the interactive parts of the interface.
**Example:** Adding clickable buttons, forms, and search bars in the wireframe shows how users will interact with the system.
