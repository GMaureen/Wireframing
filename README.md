# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a basic visual guide or blueprint that represents the layout and structure of a digital product such as a website or an application. It shows the placement of elements like buttons, images, and text without focusing on colors, styles, or detailed design.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process because it:
- Helps plan the structure and functionality before coding begins
- Serves as a communication tool between designers, developers, clients, and stakeholders
- Allows quick iteration and experimentation at low cost
- Helps identify usability issues early and reduces rework later

## How to Use This Repo
This repository contains an introduction to wireframing and can be expanded with:
- Example low-fidelity wireframes (images or SVGs)
- Links to tools (e.g., Figma, Sketch)
- A simple wireframe checklist

## Conclusion
Wireframes turn abstract ideas into clear layouts that guide design and development. They save time and help teams align on product structure early on.
